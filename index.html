		<p>Daniella Jones is from 95', a change of millenniums’s child. She has her roots in the capital city of Denmark, Copenhagen and lives between there and her favorite city, Barcelona. Jones has been painting since she first laid her eyes on a brush which has led to a love of the craft, shining through as a painter. She is self-taught with respect to the learning-by-doing mentality and she acknowledges the importance of being a student of the craft which mirrors in her contemporary style. As Jones' paintings progressed she began working as a professionel artist 5 years ago. Hard to stop, she has been unable to limit herself to a specific sector of the painting world and on that account she has been working with both private contacts and businesses, national and international. However, on this site you will primarily find her own favorite originals works. (If you intend to find Jones' commissions you can try to snup them out on her Instagram; @dandanjones).Daniella Jones is from 95', a change of millenniums’s child.
